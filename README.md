# Multivariable_Calculus

Multivariable Calculus is by far one of the most important, yet difficult branches of bachelor-level mathematics. Combined with Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, 
Numerical Analysis and Statistics, it represents one of the "Big Five" of Engineering Mathematics. 

These notes have been created using Jupyter Notebook and Paint.NET to help me better visualize certain concepts like Line Integrals, Curls, and Divergence better. Jupyter
Notebook along with Python's excellent matplotlib allows visualization of 3D curves and surfaces, and you can create them, rotate them around, which gives far better
idea of a concept than just reading it or memorizing identities.

The notes are still incomplete, but I hope the repository will be helpful to others in the future.
